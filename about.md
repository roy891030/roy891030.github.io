## Self-Introduction

Hi, I’m <span style="background-color: #fff3b0;">Lo Yi</span>!  
A <span style="background-color: #fff3b0;">nature-loving, tech-savvy digital nomad</span> who sees <span style="background-color: #fff3b0;"><strong>programming as a form of creation</strong></span>.  
I’m passionate about:

- <span style="background-color: #fff3b0;">Creating content</span> and interactive workshops  
- Applying technology creatively to enhance learning and life

Notable experiences:
- Designed a <span style="background-color: #fff3b0;"><strong>grade management system</strong></span> for my elementary school teacher mom, reducing her manual work through data visualization.
